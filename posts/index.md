# Welcome to My Mathematical Garden 🌱

This is my living notebook — a growing collection of notes, reflections, and research sketches at the intersection of **mathematics**, **logic**, and **philosophy**.

Here you'll find a blend of:
- 🧮 **Formal reasoning** — from set theory to category theory
- 🧠 **Foundational inquiry** — on the nature of truth, structure, and proof
- 🌀 **Philosophical reflections** — inspired by thinkers like Gödel, Kant, Nagarjuna, Lawvere

## 🌐 Purpose

This garden is not a finished archive, but a **space to think in public**. It evolves as I learn, and documents the movement of my mind through:
- **Mathematical logic & foundations**
- **Category theory** as structural metaphysics
- The role of **abstraction** in knowledge
- The limits of **formalism** and the question of **meaning**

## 🔍 Start Exploring

- [[Category Theory]] – notes on structure, functors, Yoneda, and beyond
- [[Logic]] – from propositional to intuitionistic and categorical logic
- [[Philosophy of Mathematics]] – thoughts on platonism, formalism, intuitionism
- [[Foundational Projects]] – ongoing research inquiries and sketches

Or begin here: [[Start here]]

## ✍️ About Me

I'm an undergraduate student of **Mathematics & Philosophy**, currently exploring how the abstract structures of logic and category theory might not just **describe** mathematics, but **reveal deeper truths** about knowledge, existence, and mind.

I am particularly interested in:
- Gödel’s incompleteness and its metaphysical reach
- Category theory as a unifying and philosophical grammar
- The ontology of mathematics: is structure all there is?
