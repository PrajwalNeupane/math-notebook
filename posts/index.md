# Summer 2025 — Ongoing Work & Wonderings

This notebook is where I’m keeping track of the things I’m working on and thinking through this summer — slowly, steadily, and mostly because I enjoy it.

Right now, I’m mainly focused on:

- **Graph Isomorphism** – reading through the Grohe–Neuen paper, building understanding.
- **Quant + C++** – reviewing probability, writing some code, trying to get sharper at algorithmic thinking.

---

## 🧮 Math Notes

- – research notes, questions, and paper thoughts
-– quant review, problem-solving log, and C++ bits
-– slow-build notes on functors, Yoneda, etc.
- – mostly foundational definitions and structure

# Summer 2025 — Ongoing Work & Wonderings

This notebook is where I’m keeping track of the things I’m working on and thinking through this summer — slowly, steadily, and mostly because I enjoy it.

Right now, I’m mainly focused on:

- **Graph Isomorphism** – reading through the Grohe–Neuen paper, building understanding, and possibly working with a professor on this.
- **Quant + C++** – reviewing probability, writing some code, trying to get sharper at algorithmic thinking.
- And as always, following threads in **logic, structure, and philosophy** when they catch my attention.

## 🧮 Math Notes

- [[graph-isomorphism]]– research notes, questions, and paper thoughts
- [[quant]] – quant review, problem-solving log, and C++ bits
- [[category-theory]] – slow-build notes on functors, Yoneda, etc.
- [[topology]] – mostly foundational definitions and structure

## 📐 Philosophy of Math

- [[proofs-and-refutations-lakatos]] – notes from Lakatos’ book, some reflections
- general thoughts on foundations, logic, and structure

## 📝 Extras

- [[poems]] – when thoughts start turning into fragments or verses

If you’re here, you probably know me — but just in case:  
I’m Prajwal, studying Math & Philosophy. I’m trying to learn things that feel real and interesting. This site helps me keep track of where my attention has been.
