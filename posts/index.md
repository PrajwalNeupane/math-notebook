# Summer 2025 â€” Ongoing Work & Wonderings

This notebook is where Iâ€™m keeping track of the things Iâ€™m working on and thinking through this summer â€” slowly, steadily, and mostly because I enjoy it.

Right now, Iâ€™m mainly focused on:

- **Graph Isomorphism** â€“ reading through the Groheâ€“Neuen paper, building understanding.
- **Quant + C++** â€“ reviewing probability, writing some code, trying to get sharper at algorithmic thinking.

## ğŸ§® Math Notes

- â€“ research notes, questions, and paper thoughts
-â€“ quant review, problem-solving log, and C++ bits
-â€“ slow-build notes on functors, Yoneda, etc.
- â€“ mostly foundational definitions and structure

# Summer 2025 â€” Notes, Structure, and Ongoing Questions

This notebook is where Iâ€™m keeping track of the ideas and problems Iâ€™m exploring this summer â€” across graph theory, quantitative methods, and the deeper philosophical structures that underlie them.

Right now, my main focus is:

- Studying the graph isomorphism problem in detail â€” reading [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01366), taking notes, and thinking toward possible research directions.
- Building a stronger foundation in probability, algorithms, and C++ â€” preparing for future work in quant, but also sharpening the tools I need to think clearly and build things that matter.

Alongside that, I return often to questions in mathematical logic, category theory, and the philosophy of mathematics â€” the kinds of questions that shape how we understand structure, truth, and meaning.
