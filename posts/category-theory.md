### Category Theory 

- a new and fundamental insight about the nature of mathematics. 
- a category = mathematical universe 
- ingredients = objects, maps, composition of maps 
- 'A general theory of natural equivalencesâ€™ Eilenberg and Mac Lane
- Spatially, think about the resolution of vectors in space. 
	- For Gallelio to accurately talk about projectile motions, he needed to have the following understanding:
	- As time passes, each moment in time has an associated position in space described by some map. 
	- In this space there are projections onto planes (shadows) and heights (lines) and given a shadow and a height, the object is completely defined in space. 
	- In essence, for each moment in time there is an associated position in space and for each position is in space there is a shadow and a height which completely describe it. 
	- Time maps to space which maps to planes and maps to lines. 
	- This paints a picture of math being used in a certain "category", a certain mathematical universe where maps and this idea of multiplication of planes and lines into space is defined.
