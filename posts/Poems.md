# What happened?

*How do I explain a sliver of colossal structures*  
Collapsing, Cascading, tumultuous —  
Like a rotten gum in a toddler’s mouth  
Scintillating, Suffocating, veinous —  
Each root shivers alerting the crown,  
Begging to be pulled out.  

It knows of only one end beyond the pain —  
The shivering only ends with rupture.  

How then does the child describe the location of their tooth,  
For he is asked,  
**"What happened?"**

Fearful of rupture, desiring release,  
The child replies:  
> *"How do I explain a sliver of colossal structures?"*

# But you forgot

Eternities ago, we met at the crevice of spring —  
But you forgot.  

Cupping your hands, you drew from the infinite well —  
But you forgot.  

You sipped, and you drank,  
You dipped, and you sank.  

The abyss awaits with its pangs of solitude —  
Melancholy and dread from disunion.  

You keep forgetting  
The crevice of the spring  
Where we met.

# To pen or not to Pen?

Penning you would mean imprisoning you.  
Not penning you would mean imprisoning me.  

Oh Child O’ mine, will you find your way?  
For the box has sharp edges,  
Demanding to split you,  
Divide your love.  

But forget not:  
> *Split love is no love at all.*  

Two cannot love,  
For neither you are nor I am.  

Neither is penning,  
Nor imprisoning.  

**I love you.**  
**I love.**  
**Love.**

# Who is a poet?

Twisty words, gnarly structure,  
Juxtaposed against lulling and luring —  

Scaffolding of metaphors with wit seeping in.  
Precise is the tone,  
Teasing, the language.  

Layers unfold as the same tunes strike  
Within the reader and the poet.  

Alas! A surprise!  

> *For who is truly a poet if not her words?*  
> *If not her metaphors?*  
> *If not her teasing?*

And what is truly poetry without surprise?  

Is it even possible for the same tunes  
To arise within the reader and the poet?  

For what does the reader know of the rhythm  
That drove the poet away from her cozy bed?  

Surprise assumes discord.  
Poetry assumes harmony.  

There is no poetry without surprise.  

> That which twists familiarly,  
> Does not twist at all.  

Twisting assumes surprise.  

What is poetry without twisty words?  
And who is a poet without poetry?

# In Search of Solitude

The arching branch innocuously bobs  
Under the guidance of the wind.  

Fanned-out, finger-like leaves  
Brush an invisible canvas —  
Masterpiece after masterpiece blowing away.  

The benefactor of the bobbing  
Receives what is hers.  

This echo chamber of bobbing and brushing and masterpieces  
Reminds me of my search for solitude,  
Invigoratingly disturbed by the crowds.  

My shaking fingers fill out canvas after canvas.  
My bobbing wrist knows not of the tears at the tip of my pen.  

Bobbing, brushing, masterpieces —  
The benefactor receives what is hers.

# no water ever has asked

Water asked the thirsty barren basin:  
> *"How may I caress you?  
> For we have been long apart."*

Dry and dusty, rocks and reefs  
Cried out in fractal scatter and heaves.  

"Oh lover mine, worry not of overestimation.  
You are to touch me as the lethal strike of a warhead —  
Piercing through my dryness,  
Invigorating my solitude.  

For it is I who have lamented to blue skies.  
For it is I who have painted the canvas with white.  

Where do you gather the courage to ask questions?  
Why must the painter answer?  
Is my art not as loud as the thundering sky?

A question pulsating naïveté —  
Insulting to our union.  

For such sacred is our love —  

Have the birds asked the atmosphere  
How may I caress you with my songs?

Have the tadpoles expressed curiosity  
About the flinging nature of their tails?

Have the hungry asked  
How may I caress food?

Have the thirsty asked  
How may I caress water?

Why then, do you — water — ask:  
> *"How may I caress you?"*

And so,  
**No water ever has asked a dry river basin,**  
> *"How may I caress you?"*
